Temperature Gun:

-> Eeprom must be at erased condition before turning ON the system.
-> After measuring request , turn Eeprom Power at first and after certain delay turn ON 
  the Chip Power
-> Take reading.But this reading feedback is taken through the Trigger Button(that goes
   LOW on pressing it)
-> After measure is detected, turn OFF the Chip Power(Must important!!) .Then request for the valid
   data which always resides in Location 80(Lower Byte) and 81(Higher Byte).
-> After read operation, always erase the Chip from Locations 0 to 10(may be changed, I don't know)
   to ensure that that the Eeprom is in state as described in the first point.


BP Meter:

-> After measuring request, turn ON the merely power to the system.After certain delay
  pull the Measuring Pin LOW!
-> This is Open Loop System. We do not know when will the measuring finish, So wait
   for some seconds (may be 50) after which it will finish its measuring.
->Then erase the Eeprom (by putting SOMETHING(1) in address 0) and turn off the meter.
